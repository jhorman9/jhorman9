# Hi, I'm Jhorman Nieto P! 👋

I would like to highlight my ongoing interest in learning and staying updated in the field of software development and emerging technologies. Throughout the day, I engage in software development practice and keep abreast of the latest innovations. During my free time, I conduct research and take courses to expand my skill set. I find equal enjoyment in teaching what I have learned and learning from others.

## 🤖 Profile
👩‍💻 Currently, I'm working on the frontend using React with Redux, and on the backend, I'm utilizing NodeJs + Express with PostgreSQL.

🧠 I'm currently learning Nest.js, Next.js, PHP and Laravel.
